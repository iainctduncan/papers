<h1>Features and Usage<a class="headerlink" href="#features-and-usage" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h1>
<p>In this chapter we will dicsuss s4m from a user’s perspective.
We assume some familiarity with the Max platform, though readers unfamiliar with Max should be able to follow along.
Where we indicate that a message is sent to the s4m object, we are referring to a Max message, such as would come from a message box connected to inlet 0.</p>
<section id="installation">
<h2>Installation<a class="headerlink" href="#installation" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p>Scheme for Max is released as a Max Package, containing the s4m and s4m.grid externals, a variety of Scheme source files, an extensive help patch demonstrating features and use, and some example patches and Max for Live devices using S4M.
To use S4M, the Max user downloads the package file and uncompresses it in their Max “Packages” directory, after which it will be possible to create an <strong>s4m</strong> object in a Max patch.</p>
</section>
<section id="object-initialization">
<h2>Object Initialization<a class="headerlink" href="#object-initialization" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<section id="bootstrap-files">
<h3>Bootstrap files<a class="headerlink" href="#bootstrap-files" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h3>
<p>When the s4m object is instantiated in a patcher, it will initialize itself by loading the bootstrap file, <strong>s4m.scm</strong>.
This contains Scheme code on which the documented s4m functionality depends, and loads several other Scheme dependencies,
This file is available for inspection and alteration by the user, and it is expected that advanced users will alter their bootstrap file, perhaps loading additional files that they intend to be using regularly.</p>
<p>By default, the boostrap file loads <strong>s74.scm</strong>, which contains additional Scheme definitions that are not specific to Max.
s74 is intended to be an extension to s7 that includes convenience features that users from other Lisp dialects may be used to.
Bill S. intends to keep s7 minimal, thus rather than fork s7, I have added s74 as an optional layer.
It adds various higher-level convenice functions taken from or inspired by larger Scheme implementations such as Chez, as well as Clojure, Racket, and Common Lisp.</p>
<p>The bootstrap file also loads several files that are packaged with s7 itself but are optional: <strong>stuff.scm</strong>, <strong>loop.scm</strong>, and <strong>utilities.scm</strong>.
These define several macros borrowed from Common Lisp and used in Common Music, such as <strong>loop</strong>, <strong>dolist</strong>, and <strong>dotimes</strong>.</p>
<p>Once the s4m object has loaded s4m.scm and its subsequent dependencies, it is ready to be used.</p>
<p>Sending the s4m object the “reset” message will re-initialize the object, recreating the s7 interpreter and reloading the bootstrap files.</p>
</section>
<section id="source-files">
<h3>Source Files<a class="headerlink" href="#source-files" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h3>
<p>The user can load source files into the s4m object in several ways.
The primary way is to provide a file name as the first argument in the s4m object box.
S4M will search the Max file paths (user configured paths for source code) to find the named file, and will load it.
This file is then considered the main file for the object instance.
Double clicking the s4m box will print the full path to the main file in the console.</p>
<p>Sending s4m a <strong>reload</strong> message will reload the main file, <em>without</em> resetting the interpreter.</p>
<p>Sending s4m a <strong>source some-file.scm</strong> message will load some-file.scm and set it as the main source file.
This can be useful in cases, such as in a Max for Live device, where it may be convenient not to have to edit the Max patch to change the main file.
For example, one might create a device where a text box can be updated and is interpolated into a <strong>source</strong> message, allowing a user of the device, who may not have the ability to edit devices, to change the main file.</p>
<p>The <strong>read some-file.scm</strong> will load a file (again searching on the Max file path) without resetting the interpreter or changing the s4m main file.
This is useful when working on a program or piece while it runs - we can put state variable and score data in one file, and algorithms in another, reloading the algorithm file while we work on it while leaving the state data intact.
This pattern is something I have personally found to be very productive, and while it would technically be possible to replicate to some degree with the JS object, doing so would be cumbersome at best.</p>
<p>In the event that the user has multiple like named files on their Max search path, Max will load the first one it finds, and print a message to the Max console indicating that multiple source files were found and which one it loaded.
(This is a feature of Max, and has nothing to do with s4m specifically - it comes with the use of the SDK functions to load files from the search path.)</p>

<section id="inlets-and-outlets">
<h3>Inlets and Outlets<a class="headerlink" href="#inlets-and-outlets" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h3>
<p>By default, the s4m object will be created with 1 inlet and 1 outlet.
The <strong>&#64;ins</strong> and <strong>&#64;outs</strong> attribute arguments can be used to create additional inlets and outlets, to a maxium of 32 outlets.
While these are implemented as Max <em>attributes</em>, they cannot be changed in the Max object inspector as their number must be set before object initialization.
They can only be set as &#64; arguments in the object box.</p>
</section>
</section>
<section id="input">
<h2>Input<a class="headerlink" href="#input" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<section id="inlet-0-scheme-expressions">
<h3>Inlet 0 Scheme Expressions<a class="headerlink" href="#inlet-0-scheme-expressions" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h3>
<p>Input to the s4m object works differently depending on whether one uses the main inlet (inlet 0) or subsequent inlets.
A common pattern in Max objects is for objects to accept “meta” messages in inlet 0 - messages that are about the object but are not calls to execute the objects main functionality.
S4M follows this pattern, and supports a number of meta messages, of which we have already mentioned several: read, reset, reload, and source.
These are implemented as handlers in the C code, and we will refer to these as “reserved messages”.</p>
<p>Any messages to inlet 0 that are not handled as reserved messages are taken to be Scheme calls.
Internally, S4M adds enclosing parentheses around any non-reserved messages that do not already start and end with parentheses, and then passes the message to the s7 interpreter for evaluation.
The return value from evaluation is printed to the console (there exists additional messages to control how much is printed to the console, see the documentation for details).</p>
<p>As Max messages are space delimited and can contain only integers, floating point numbers, symbols, and strings, we are guaranteed that a Max message enclosed inparentheses is valid Scheme.
Messages with enclosing parentheses are always evaluated as Scheme code, and can include nested expressions.</p>
<p>This facility makes it very straightforward for a user to add input mechanisms to their programs.
For example, if they want a number box to update a variable, they can use dollar sign interpolation in a message such as <strong>set! var-name $1</strong>, connecting a number box or dial to this message, and connecting the message box to inlet 0.
Moving the number box will now result in Scheme calls to set the my-var variable to the value chosen.
This facility significantly reduces the amount of code the user must write to make interactive patches when compared to the Max JS object, as the JS object
requires explicit handler methods to be made for any input.</p>
<p>A result of this input facility is that when one uses a symbol in a Max message sent to inlet 0, the interpreter will take this to be a variable name in the running Scheme program.
Should the user wish to pass in a symbol, they can use the standard Scheme leading single quotation mark to quote the symbol.
The can also use an s7 keyword - a symbol beginning with a colon - in which case evaluation does not change the fact that the keyword is a symbol.
Conveniently, Max does not assign any special meaning to either single quotation marks or colons, thus this presents no issue from Max messages.</p>
<p>For the majority of use cases, this is the easiest way to send input to s4m.
When one wants to do something with an argument from Max, one can use message interpolation or the <strong>prepend</strong> object to turn the incoming argument into a Scheme expression, and have the interpreter evaluate it.</p>
<p>There do exist, however, several convenience functions in case users want to handle input with less going on in their Max patch.
The <strong>f-int</strong>, <strong>f-float</strong>, <strong>f-bang</strong>, and <strong>f-list</strong> handers are automatically invoked when the object receives an integer, float, bang, or list respectively.
If the user defines a function so named, it will be invoked.
(They are named <strong>f-{{type}}</strong> simply to avoid the inconsistency that would result had we used <strong>int</strong>, <strong>float</strong>, and <strong>bang</strong>, as <strong>list</strong> is a built in Scheme function.)
Essentially, one can visualize this as if, on incoming integer messages (for example), the symbol <strong>f-int</strong> was prepended.</p>
</section>
<section id="inlet-1">
<h3>Inlet 1+<a class="headerlink" href="#inlet-1" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h3>
<p>There are times when it is not convenient that the incoming symbols in Max messages are taken as variable names (because they are evaluated).
An example of this is dealing with incoming OSC messages, where one may not have full control over the incoming parts of the messages, and thus inserting single quotation marks to indicate symbols is not practical.
For these instances, one can use an inlet beyond inlet 0, which require explicit handler registration.</p>
