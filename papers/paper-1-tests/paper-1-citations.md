Computer Music Journal Winter 2002 (Vol.
26, Number 4) from Miller Puckette and David Ziccarelli.


"Officially at least, communications between boxes all take 
place via Max messages, which are extremely simple in structure and 
standardized in content. Messages are linear lists of atoms, which 
in turn may be either numbers or strings. (In Max and jmax, the numbers
may be of two distinct types; Pd eliminates this distinction.)
Messages are always headed by a symbol, which acts as a Smalltalk-style
message selector. (Messages may appear to begin with a number, but 
or these mes- sages Max always provides an understood selector, such as list.)"
