George Feedback
- 
- can make own commands for highlighting, hiding
- intro reads well
- see if I can re-use patcher screen shots, get it down 2 to 3
- delete the implicit message stuff or put in appendix
- footnote the implict 

- thoughts about the C code
  - could be a little bit reduced 
  - samples should use the 'listings' package 

- look up how to put the code - look for package for it

- citations:
  - if there is an academic paper behind it, it should be cited
  - cite the algorithmic and live-coding papers
  - history of Max?
  - do I cite SDK docs? - can be a regular citations or directly in text
    - use package 'url' 
  - can I also say for more information
  - for website can also say when it was accessed

- fix the code in the paper code for the memory leak if there's in time
 
Citations
- 10-20 should be good 
- Eric Lyon's 
- externals from his book:
- if I can find citations for the other packages do so (extempore)

Conclusion:
- summarize the paper 
- mention the pure data port
-  
  
- do I need to demo the javascript
- could add Js example
- could add more on justifaction for using it in the max environment

- to do, define control pass
- do I need to be pedantic about procedure vs function and param vs argument?
