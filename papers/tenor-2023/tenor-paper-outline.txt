Using lisp macros as scores with Scheme for Max & Scheme for Pd

advantages
- a textual score can take advantage of tools for working in plain text 
- the score is a program, it is parsed and run, from top to bottom
  - as such elements of how the score works can be redefined part way through processing of a score
    by calling functions

- as the elements of the score are translated to function calls

- inversion of control - what the score means can be easily changed by the composer-programmer without 
  changing the score parser 

Points to make
- in a text score systems, we have a score parser - that which takes in the incoming text and transforms
it into something usable by other parts of the program.
In a normal case this would be a data structure that is then consumed by other parts of the program.
For example, in Csound, the orchestra score is parsed to become the orchestra data. 
Some program (our score parser) is run and uses this text as input. 
This program is typically complex beyond that which would be hackable by the user composer

- main point of comparison can be csound I guess

- the output of a macro based score could be either a data structure or file for further use
  or execution of calls in real time, putting events on the scheduler.

- how to explain macros
  

Nomenclature:
- we will call the composer-programmer and the framework-programmer
