This folder contains some optional "modules" you can enable in the compiled output. They will add additional features to your project. If you have no need of them, they can be safely discarded. Note that some require additional material to be used elsewhere---for example indexing is established in the preamble, but we will need to declare the position of the index itself in the back matter.
