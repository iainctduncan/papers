Foreward
Non-fiction works often feature a foreword or preface. This usually comes after the table of contents, but not always—sometimes the foreword precedes the table of contents. If you need your foreword to come before the table of contents, move the \tableofcontents command in the “Preamble Addendum” document after “Foreword” document. You can also rename “Foreword” to ”Preface” or ”Introduction”, or delete it entirely, depending on your requirements.
The table of contents is generated automatically by LATEX, using the natural structure of the Draft folder’s outline in Scrivener’s. If you were using Scrivener in a more typical fashion, there would be a long list of instructions here on how to create a table of contents and manually keep it up to date over time.

Folder Names as Chapter Titles
The goal of this template is make the composition and drafting phase as simple and elegant as possible. It is not meant to turn Scrivener, a rich text editor, into a full-blown LaTeX generator (you’ll need to use MultiMarkdown or Pandoc for that). Instead, this project contains a number of convenience features that could be applied to your work as you wish in an la carte fashion, to alleviate how much code you’d need to type in yourself. For example, if you find handling images to be cumbersome in LaTeX, you can safely leave that up to the template.
Ultimately, it’s goal is to cater to those that by and large prefer to compose directly in LaTeX itself, and will be approaching Scrivener primarily as an organ- isational and composition tool for constructing a longer .tex file from the smaller snippets written into the Draft folder.
1.1 How To Use This Template
1. Inside the “Draft” folder, create a new folder for each chapter and title each folder with the name of the chapter. (You do not need to—and indeed shouldn’t—title the folders “Chapter One” and so on, because chapter num- bering will typically be taken care of automatically by LaTeX.) The first chapter folder has been created for you with the placeholder title “Chapter”.
2. Create a new text document for each section inside the chapter folders. Sec- tions will be numbered and titled by LaTeX using hierarchical numbering (1.1, 1.2, 1.3).
3. Nest documents beneath documents to create numbered subsections, subsub- sections and unnumbered paragraphs, at 3rd, 4th and 5th levels of hierarchy respectively.

CHAPTER 1. FOLDER NAMES AS CHAPTER TITLES 2
4. If you need to create the occasional unnumbered section, the Informal Chap-
ter and Informal Section Types are there for you.
5. If you don’t require a foreword, move the “Foreword” document in the Front Matter folder to the Trash folder. Alternatively, rename it “Preface”, “Ab- stract” or “Introduction” as you require. Any other prefacing materials could be placed between the preamble and the main matter document.
6. “Notes” and “Ideas” folders have been provided for your convenience, al- though you can replace them or create different top-level folders for your research materials if necessary (these are just regular folders that have had custom icons assigned to them using the Documents&gt;Change Icon feature).
1.2 Some Sample Content
Foremost, any LaTeX you type in yourself will be dutifully conveyed to the output. The compile settings also have a few shortcuts you can use to ease typing, or grant yourself a nicer looking working document. Graphics that you place into the editor (linked or embedded) will be exported simply wherever they occur in the text. For more formal figures there are two approaches you can take (you needn’t commit to either exclusively).
Figures
Figure 1.1: This is the caption.
To modify how styled text is converted to LaTeX code, visit the Markup and Styles compile format panes, when editing this project’s ”LaTeX (Memoir Book)” format. The Markup pane itself sets how graphics print themselves, which is the \includegraphics line alone. The stylesheet settings for Figure, Caption and Label determine how the additional syntax is added around that.

CHAPTER 1. FOLDER NAMES AS CHAPTER TITLES 3 Equations
We can also insert equations as discrete items in the binder, making them easy to reference and look up by type. It also means we can refer to them in our writings with the use of simple internal document links (Equation 1.1).
x2 = 5−√25−4×6 =2 (1.1) 2
When you need to refer to an equation in the body text (β = (β1, β2, . . . , βn)), you can use the Inline Equation style which will insert the $ and $ codes for you.
Equations can also be inserted unnumbered

Another Chapter Folder
Begin each new chapter on a new top level folder like this. With LaTeX, the chapter numbering and formatting is handled automatically by the typesetting engine. Scrivener is only responsible for assembling the LaTeX code that will be used to generate these structures.
If you need parts, or if you don’t need chapters, the automatic assignment of structure to the outline can be adjusted in project settings, under the Section Types pane.

About This Template
The goal of this template is make the composition and drafting phase as simple and elegant as possible. It is not meant to turn Scrivener, a rich text editor, into a full-blown LaTeX generator (you'll need to use MultiMarkdown or Pandoc for that; consider using the General Non-Fiction template if that is what you are looking for). Instead, this project contains a number of convenience features that could be applied to your work as you wish in an à la carte fashion, to alleviate how much code you'd need to type in yourself. For example, if you find handling images to be cumbersome in LaTeX, you can safely leave that up to the template.

This template caters to those that by and large prefer to compose directly in LaTeX itself, and will be approaching Scrivener primarily as an organisational and composition tool for constructing a longer .tex file from the smaller snippets written into the Draft folder.

When compiled (File ▸ Compile…), this project will generate a bare bones .tex document (using the flexible Memoir class) suitable for many types of work, fiction and non-fiction alike. The template achieves this by using advanced features available to the Plain Text compile file type, including providing the default extension of ".tex" instead of ".txt".

How To Use This Template
	◆	Inside the “Draft” folder, create a new folder for each chapter and title each folder with the name of the chapter. (LaTeX itself will of course handle all numbering schemes.) The first chapter folder has been created for you with the placeholder title “Chapter”.
	◆	Create a new text document for each section inside the chapter folders. Sections will be numbered and titled by LaTeX using hierarchical numbering (1.1, 1.2, 1.3).
	◦	Nest documents beneath documents to create numbered subsections, subsubsections and unnumbered paragraphs, at 3rd, 4th and 5th levels of hierarchy respectively.
	◦	You can of course also nest folders if you prefer.
	◆	If you need to create the occasional unnumbered section, the Informal Chapter and Informal Section Types can be manually applied to those sections.
	◆	If you don’t require a foreword, move the “Foreword” document in the Front Matter folder to the Trash folder. Alternatively, rename it “Preface”, “Abstract” or “Introduction” as you require. Adjust the title, table of contents and other front matter material within this folder, placing any additional front matter sections between the “Begin Document” and “Begin Main Matter” items.
	◆	“Notes” and “Ideas” folders have been provided for your convenience, although you can replace them or create different top-level folders for your research materials if necessary (these are just regular folders that have had custom icons assigned to them using the Documents ▸ Change Icon feature).

General Writing Tips
Foremost, any LaTeX you type in yourself will be dutifully conveyed to the output. As such, you can treat the main editor in Scrivener much like you would a dedicated text editor such as TeXShop. You may still prefer to use another editor to construct LaTeX syntax more easily, or take advantage of the syntax highlighting these types of editors can afford. Simply copy and paste the results of your writings into Scrivener when you’re ready to “save” them.

Adjusting Outline Structure
Scrivener is designed so that you can use the Draft outline flexibly. The default settings for this template are set up to consider all items at the first level within the draft as chapters. Beneath that, all items will be considered sections, subsections and so on down to the \paragraph environment. To adjust these settings, use the Project ▸ Project Settings… menu command, click on the “Section Types” pane, and then the “Default Types by Structure” tab. For example, if you wanted the top level of the Draft to use parts instead of chapters, you could select “Part” (which has already been set up for you) for the Level 1 assignments, and then adjust all greater levels of depth accordingly.

It is also worth noting that under default settings, if you omit a title for a binder item it will become "anonymous", not producing any title material and by extension opting out of being a part of the formal structure of the document as compiled. You could also manually assign an item to the “N/A” section type to cause it to be printed as-is, if you would prefer to give it an casual outlining title.

Compiling
	◆	The “Front Matter” folder contains some example preamble of the sort that would follow the more rudimentary setup of the document's overall look and feel (that is delegated to the compile Format itself, making it possible to create your own target formats and switch document classes with a single click).
	◆	A “Back Matter” folder is also provided. Here you can add any back matter you wish to include before the final \end{document} command. Nothing provided in this folder is necessary for a simple document to be typeset.  An example structure has been provided for including an appendix. The folder itself is assigned to the "Appendix" Section Type, which is responsible for titling the section and then starting the formal appendix portion of the document. Within that folder the ordinary structural rules for the Draft folder will be adhered to, meaning you can construct complex appendices with sections, subsections and so forth, based on the hierarchy of the outline. If you do not need an appendix, you can remove this folder.

	◆	To compile:
	◦	Go to File ▸ Compile…
	◦	Next to “Compile for”, select “Plain Text (.txt)”.
	◦	Select the “LaTeX (Memoir Book)” compile format on the left.
	◦	Ensure that the “Add front matter” button is ticked under the contents list on the right. If you do not do this the resulting .tex file will not properly typeset until the example material has been copied to an area included in the compile (such as the top of the Draft folder). The “Add back matter” feature is optional.
	◦	Click on “Compile”, open the .tex file in your preferred editor and typeset the document.

	◆	To compile directly to PDF:
	◦	Go to File ▸ Compile...
	◦	Double-click the “LaTeX (Memoir Book)” compile format to edit it.
	◦	Click on the Processing compile format pane.
	◦	Enable the “Post-Process on command-line” option to enable the built-in script.
	◦	Optional: click the “Edit Script” button and review the script for any changes you would like to make. The script is set up to use XeLaTeX, you might prefer to use the -pdf switch instead, for pdflatex output.
	◦	Optional: ensure that the Environment field includes the path to your texbin (for example “/Library/TeX/texbin”, as set up by MacTex).
	◦	Click the “Save” button, and then “Compile”. Note you will be supplying the name of the intermediary .tex file. The .pdf will use the base name, so “something.tex” will become “something.pdf” in the end.

	◆	To create your own document class variation:
	◦	Go to File ▸ Compile…
	◦	Right-click on the “LaTeX (Memoir Book)” compile format on the left, and select Duplicate &amp; Edit Format….
	◦	Rename the format at the top to match your intended edits.
	◦	Click on the Text Layout compile format preference pane.
	◦	Modify the prefix and suffix fields to include you preferred preamble and footer.
	◦	Since some of the LaTeX code used elsewhere in the settings may require adjustment to work outside of Memoir, you might need to audit the rest of the format's panes and content therein.
	◦	Click on “Save”.

Final Note
Scrivener project templates are flexible and are not intended to restrict you to a particular workflow. You can change, delete or move the files and folders contained in the template to suit how you work.

Like all templates in Scrivener, this project was originally created from the “Blank” template. We’ve simply added a few things to the binder and set everything up in ways that should be useful to authors working toward the LaTeX typesetting system. Everything you can do with this project, you could equally do by creating a “Blank” project and setting it up yourself.

You can create your own templates by setting up a skeletal project with the files, folders and settings you would like to use for new projects and using File ▸ Save As Template.

The rest of this guide will go over the numerous convenience features that have been added to this project.

Figures
To ease typing extensive syntax and managing your images by hand, or to simply grant yourself a nicer looking working document, you can make use of Scrivener’s native inline &amp; linked image handling facilities. Graphics that you place into the editor will be exported as files and syntax will be inserted where the image was placed. For more formal figures there are two approaches you can take (you needn't commit to either exclusively):

	◆	In your text: use the "Figure" paragraph style to have the graphic enclosed in a \begin{figure} \centering ... \end{figure} environment. You can optionally insert a caption below the image (still within the "Figure" paragraph style, so as to keep it within the environment), using the "Caption" character style. Follow the caption with a "Label" styled phrase that is a valid LaTeX style bookmark label, to give this figure a cross-reference you can refer to elsewhere. With an eye on the Format Bar, click into the three different elements below; image, caption and label, to see which styles are applied to them:

#
This is the caption. latexLogo

The example provided above would generate the following LaTeX syntax when compiled:

\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=175pt,height=73pt]{800px-LaTeX_logo.png}
\caption{This is the caption.} 
\label{latexLogo}
\end{figure}

	◆	As a binder item: if you prefer keeping figures in separate chunks in the binder, to facilitate searching and organisation, you can use the "Figure" Section Type setting, placing the graphic in the main editor (un-styled) and supplying the caption as custom metadata in the Inspector. (A document template has been supplied for your convenience, and with an Example Figure item in the “Research” folder for your reference.) When using this technique figure labelling will be handled automatically for you, and captioning will be done in the inspector sidebar. To cross-reference to the figure in the text, refer to the following section on cross-referencing.

Figure Customisation
To modify how styled text and embedded images are converted to LaTeX code, visit the Markup and Styles compile format panes, when editing this project's "LaTeX (Memoir Book)" format. The Markup pane itself sets how graphics print themselves, which is the \includegraphics line alone. The stylesheet settings for Figure, Caption and Label determine how the additional syntax is added around that.

To modify how images are converted to LaTeX when including them as binder items, visit the Section Layouts compile format pane and adjust the "Figure w/ Caption" layout's Prefix and Suffix tabs. As with styled text, the Markup pane is what is used to insert the graphic itself between the prefix and suffix.

Equations
A few helpful packages for equation typesetting can be enabled with the Equation Packages module, in the front matter folder. As with figures, equations can be added either to your binder as discrete items using dedicated Section Types, or into the text itself using Styles.

	◆	In your text: use the "Equation" paragraph style to enclose the selected text within a \begin{figure} ... \end{figure} environment. Use the Label character style to supply a target label to the equation, if it should be numbered and be capable of being cross-referenced. Below is an example equation and label; note how the label character style is placed within the equation paragraph itself:

P\left(A=2\middle|\frac{A^2}{B}&gt;4\right) eq:custom-label

The example provided above would generate the following LaTeX syntax when compiled:

\begin{equation}
P\left(A=2\middle|\frac{A^2}{B}&gt;4\right) \label{eq:custom-label}
\end{equation}

	◆	As a binder item: for those that prefer to keep major elements as separate binder items, this project has two document templates designed to faciliate the organisation of equations: "Equation" and "Unnumbered Equation". If you will require cross-referencing to refer to your equations, the first option is what you want. Numbered equations will be automatically labelled for you, with that label used by internal document links pointing to it, elsewhere in the Draft. Consequently, you should not supply your own \label{...} code (or use the style) with the equation text itself. Additionally you should not use the Equation style itself, within an Equation document.

Inline equations, embedded in paragraph text, are easily formatted using raw LaTeX, but if you wish to keep your source material clean of syntax, a character style has been provided with this project. Simply paint the equation with the style, and it will add the markers for you.

Tables
Scrivener cannot convert rich text tables into LaTeX code for you. You will need to provide the proper syntax yourself, however you can focus on the tabular data itself, leaving the boilerplate text to Scrivener by making use of the “Table” Section Type when applied to individual binder items. As with binder figures, you can supply a caption as metadata. A document template has been provided as an example starting point. Working this way means you can make global adjustments to table appearance more easily, by editing the “Table w/ Caption” section layout, in the compile format settings.

Itemised and Enumerated Lists
As with tables, Scrivener cannot convert its native listing environments to LaTeX. If you would prefer the convenience of these features, for simple lists you could make use of the “Itemized List” and “Enumerated List” styles, included in this template. You will note that simple hanging indent paragraph style will be used in the editor (along with a shaded background to indicate the type of list). When compiled with the provided format, these styles will be enclosed in the proper listing environment, and will prefix each line with the \item code.

Given that basic capability, you could embellish the standard output the compiler produces with your own LaTeX code inside the styled range, and thus produce nested lists.

Creating Your Own Environments
This template includes a variety of common environments already set up for you, but it is quite likely that you will need to create your own. There are two different approaches, both demonstrated in this template:

	1.	Using Section Types: examples of this approach include the figure, table and equation setups. These are comprised of the following ingredients:
	a.	A “Section Type” that can be used to flag items in your binder as needing to be associated with a particular environment. If you look at the Table document template, you will see that in the Metadata inspector pane, it has been assigned to the “Table” section type.
	b.	A “Section Layout” in the compile format settings is what does the heavy lifting. Edit the Format for this project by going to File ▸ Compile…, right-click on the project template's Format in the left sidebar to edit it, and in the “Section Layouts” pane, examine the “Table w/ Captions” layout. The prefix and suffix tabs for this layout are where the actual LaTeX code will be inserted around the text you type in the editor.
	2.	Using Styles: when environments are more likely to be found within a longer chunk of text, and would not be so useful broken out into their own sections, styles can also be used to insert a prefix and suffix around the text you type. The “Block Quote” or even “Emphasis” styles serve as examples of how this can be done. Visit the “Styles” pane in the compile format settings to examine how prefixes and suffixes are used with them.

Cross-References
Whenever you create a document link to another document within the compiled output, Scrivener will use an internally generated bookmark label to create an \autoref{...} link to that section. This works for the following Section Types automatically:

	•	Part
	•	Chapter
	•	Section
	•	Subsection
	•	Subsubsection
	•	Figure
	•	Table
	•	Equation

LaTeX will of course handle the rest of the job, in terms of numbering and correctly labelling the links. To adjust the behaviour of the code produced by Scrivener, modify the link prefix and suffix settings in the Markup compile format pane.

Typographic Punctuation
If you prefer to use LaTeX style punctuation yourself while writing, then Scrivener will not get in your way in doing so. However if you prefer to use its automatic typographic punctuation features (smart quotes, dashes and ellipses), the compile format has been configured to convert these forms of character punctuation to old style safe ASCII LaTeX methods. If you would rather work in a modern UTF-8 environment where typographic punctuation is acceptable, you could remove or disable the conversions from the Replacements compile format pane.

Notation
If you opt to include inline annotations and comments in your output, they will be converted to marginal notes and highlights using LaTeX tools for doing so. You may also make use of Scrivener's footnote features, as they will be converted to syntax for you.

Creating an Index
To an include an index of terms, you will first need to enable the Indexing Packages front matter module, along with the Index itself in the back matter folder. To do so, visit these sections and enable the “Include in Compile” option in the inspector’s Metadata tab.

As for marking indexed terms themselves, you could of course do so by hand, but you can also make use of the Index Term and Index Key styles:

	◆	Use the “Index Term” style to mark the word or phrase, directly in the text, that you wish to add to the index. When compiled, a key based on the selected text will be generated for you.
	◆	Use the “Index Key” style if the phrase itself doesn’t appear in the text, or if you want direct control over the indexing key itself.

            <Comments>Given a quirk in how styles work with the text engine, you will need to select the image to see the "Figure" style, rather than merely placing the cursor to the left or right of it.</Comments>

This saves us from having to manually assign the “Front Matter” section type for each document we place into this folder.

During Compile, documents assigned the “Front Matter” section type will be laid out differently from documents in the main body of the manuscript.</Notes>
