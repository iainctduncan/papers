Ideas to explore:
- secondary dominants as a chain of functions that display in code much as we would see them in musical analysis
(II V7 (V ‘C))
(prog :C ‘(IIm7 V7 IM7) :F ‘(IIm7 V7 IM7)
(prog :C `(IIm7 ,(ttsub V7) IM7)
(prog I: (IIm7 (ttsub V7) IM7) IV: (IIm7 V7 I)))
(prog I: (IIm7 . (ttsub of V7 of V) 
producing a list of chord objects
the chord prog is a list of symbols, and the symbols mean something in the context of a key - exactly how they are implemented in Scheme
(prog (in C:)  `(IIm7 |  Vsus7  V7  IM7 |)
      (mod P5th)
