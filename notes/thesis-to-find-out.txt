Things I need to find out:

- is there a way to load extra files in the JS object?
  - can one load files from the file system?
  - can one reload files from the file system?

- Max JS docs say: 
"Manage global variables for use among multiple js objects or between js objects and the Max patcher."
- is there one interpreter??
