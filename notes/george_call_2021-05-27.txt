Thoughts about paper
- https://icfp21.sigplan.org/home/scheme-2021#Call-for-Papers
- exmaples from IFCP https://www.conference-publishing.com/authors.php?Event=ICFPWS16FARM
- Papers and experience reports are expected to be 10–24 pages in length using the single-column SIGPLAN acmart style. (For reference, this is about 5–12 pages of the older SIGPLAN 2-column 9pt style.)
- does not preclude republication in real journal
- need to do more work explaining Max and what it's built
- journal version should have 30% more material
- in this paper write a fair bit about Max/MSP and computer music in journal
