Thoughts about paper
- https://icfp21.sigplan.org/home/scheme-2021#Call-for-Papers
- exmaples from IFCP https://www.conference-publishing.com/authors.php?Event=ICFPWS16FARM
- Papers and experience reports are expected to be 10–24 pages in length using the single-column SIGPLAN acmart style. (For reference, this is about 5–12 pages of the older SIGPLAN 2-column 9pt style.)
- does not preclude republication in real journal
- need to do more work explaining Max and what it's built
- journal version should have 30% more material
- in this paper write a fair bit about Max/MSP and computer music in journal
 

possible topics:

- semantic similarity
  - message passing syntax matches max message passing
  - can make objects that work very similarly to how Max works
  - a max object is not an object with methods that are called 
    from patch cords in a fire and forget manner
  - for example, sending a list to an object is actually a message 
    of 'list 1 2 3', and depends on the receiver implementing a handler
    for this message

- should I make the macro for daisy chaining function calls?

- niche it fills right now
  - runs in high thread
  - can receive dynamic code from max messages (ties in with semantics thing)


Call
- need 15-20 references
  - 4 or 5 from Scheme
  - 4 or 5 live coding 
  - comparison to tidal cycles-> supercollider 
  - purpose is placing my work in the context of related work: says I'm aware of these things

- ie Max is good up to a point,   

- add more about SC, chuck, live code language
- bit more commentary on to make connection with literature on scheme
  - definitely cite Common Music, Nyquist
  - cite outside of the music domain, Naughty Dog example
  - ie Scheme  

- intro defines what we are trying to do
- related work provides the context

- need to have a related work section that cites/explains
  - typically will have a related work at the begining with cite
  - look for example of related work, most have at beginnning at 

- fundamental two questions
  - why do you want to do this
  - what were the technical challenges

- this paper:
  - embedding Scheme as a tool for flexibly scheduling future events in a music system  
  - keep threading and JS comparison, but perhaps smaller
  - for this paper we can focus on the scheduling over the semantic mapping
  - for PLC paper what feature of the lanugage are we taking advantage of and why is interesting
  - keep clear what is implementation and what is semantics

- try example of the orchestrator

- next step:
  - get it into the format
  - add some figure
  - work on the related
