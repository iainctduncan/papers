Outline

to add

- example implementation of our function
- ?how scheme for max works under the hood
- description of what goes on at C level and in Scheme
- where to put example of temporal recursion??

To put in:
- examples of use in Scheme 
- temporal recursion stuff
- introduction
- conclusion

Conclusion content
- summarize presenting Scheme for Max and the manner in which
it brings facilities to the Max environment for solving a common
use case for performers and composers of algorithmic music, one
that was not previously solved satisfactorally in Max.

Introduction
- 


- conclusion future:
 - development of Scheme for PD and a portability layer
 - use of in the audio DSP loop for creating control signals
 - improving the real-time capabilities of the garbage collector
